## Introduction
This dataset contains data for every rated Lichess game played between January 2013 and December 2014. There were approximately 15,000,000 games in total. It includes the players' names, ratings, the winner, the opening, the number of moves, etc. We will conduct an analysis to gain insights on the games and address our research questions. We hope to discover interesting patterns by analysing the various characteristics of each game, including the type of opening employed, the ratings of the players, and more. This data analysis allows us to comprehend the effects of various moves, strategies, and time controls on game outcomes. This research will also compare the performance of three Python libraries: Pandas, Vaex, and Koalas.

## Libraries
1. Pandas
2. Vaex
3. Koalas

  ## Conclusion
  * To summarize,Â **Vaex** is the best in data preparation and cleaning. However, it performed the worst in sorting the data.
  * When performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with this dataset, **Pandas** is the fastest option rather than using Vaex and Koalas.
  * For most of solving the research questions, we prefer **Koalas** more as it is the fastest library.
  * Therefore, for large dataset, we suggest to use **Vaex** for cleaning data, **Pandas** when performing EDA, and **Koalas** to do more complex task. As there are no library that are the best (have the shortest time), thus we need to choose the library properly in performing each task as mentioned above to utilize the pros of each of the library as the alternatives of pandas.
