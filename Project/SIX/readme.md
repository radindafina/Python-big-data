# **Introduction**
In this project, we will be comparing the performance of 3 different python libraries which are Dask, PySpark and Koalas on a large dataset.
These 3 libraries are the alternatives to Pandas library for faster and better performance. Every libraries has its own strength and weakness and this project will help you to determine which library you can use for your python project. We use NYC Parking Tickets dataset from Kaggle that you can download using this link. This dataset has 10 million rows and 51 columns with the size of 2GB. We will perform an EDA on the dataset using the libraries stated and give our opinions on performance, ease of use and help documentation. You will find each operation in 3 different libraries and time taken for each operation.

We will evaluate the 3 libraries using the operations performed on EDA that consists of:
* Import CSV file into dataframe
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* Data Questions and Answers

 # **Inferences and Conclusion**
â€‚After conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the NYC parking ticket dataset using Dask, PySpark, and Koalas, it is clear that each library has its own strengths and weaknesses. Dask is a powerful library for parallel processing and is well-suited for large datasets, but it can be challenging to set up and can be less intuitive than other libraries. PySpark is widely used in the big data community and is known for its scalability and ability to handle large datasets, but it can be challenging to use and has a steep learning curve. Koalas, on the other hand, provides a familiar interface to users who are familiar with Pandas, and is relatively easy to use, but its performance may not be as robust as other libraries for larger datasets.
